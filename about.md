            <h2>I'm Evan</h2>
            <p>A self-taught Full Stack Web Developer and one of the founders and web master of Cyber@UC, the University of Cincinnatiâ€™s official <a href="https://www.owasp.org/">OWASP</a> chapter.</p> 
            <p>I've been invested ever since I found out about web development. The way my interest started was during an internship, and I was told there was going to be a lack of work for the next couple of weeks. This meant that I wouldn't be able to work or do anything. For the first couple of days I endured the boredom, but after awhile I got restless. I personally don't like sitting there and not learning something, so I decided to give web development a try!</p>

        <p>I was learning about web development in my freetime while I was in college. This was a passion for me, and I couldn't stop. All of this learning eventually led up to my first job as a web dev. I really struggled during the interview. They were not sure I could handle working there, but the company gave me a shot and offered me the job. Ever since then, I have had multiple jobs that related to web dev, and I try to continuously expand my knowledge. </p>
